The Google envs we need
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
```

### Cloudinary

Go to [Cloudinry](https://cloudinary.com/), signup and navigate to the dashboard to get three keys
```bash
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=*****
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=******
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=*****
```

### Grafbase

- Go to [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com/), signup and navigate to the dashboard.
- Click on the "Create Project" and connect it to your GitHub Account to import the Github Repository (Make sure that you have already pushed the repository on GitHub)
- Now click on "Deploy"

After the successful integration, you'll see the overview of the Grafbase project. Now click on "Connect" to get the API Endpoint and API Key. The envs should be, 
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAFBASE_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAFBASE_API_KEY=
```

You can click on "View Pathfinder" to see the deployed version of your database. 

### NextAuth
We'll need two envs, i.e., NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=0BaooQUqS5YBkCheO9A5rGVJxSyCoYJ1vvsmH231Erc=
```

In production, we can replace the NEXTAUTH_URLf to prodcution URL
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://flexibble.vercel.app/
```

You can create any random NEXTAUTH_SECRET using this command. You can read more about it [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret)
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Things to know

To enable the functionality of dynamic images, we need to inform Next.js explicitly that we anticipate receiving dynamic image URLs from a particular source. This can be achieved by adjusting the configuration of Next.js as follows:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    domains: ['lh3.googleusercontent.com', 'res.cloudinary.com', 'task.com']
  },
  experimental: {
    serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['cloudinary', 'graphql-request']
  },
  eslint: {
    // Warning: This allows production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has ESLint errors.
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true
  }
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Run Next.js

Open a new terminal and,
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run Grafbase

Open another new terminal and,
```bash
npx grafbase@0.24 dev
```

After successful installation, you'll see this:
```bash
ðŸ“¡ Listening on port 4000
Pathfinder: http://127.0.0.1:4000
Endpoint:   http://127.0.0.1:4000/graphql
```

Open the local Pathfinder to perform database operations
